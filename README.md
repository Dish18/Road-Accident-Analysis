# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard
## Description
Road safety is a critical issue affecting communities worldwide. In this project, I developed a Road Accident Analytics Dashboard, a comprehensive tool for analyzing and visualizing road accident data from 2021 and 2022. This Excel-based dashboard provides stakeholders with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions to improve road safety.
## Tech Stack Used
Advanced Excel
## Key Competencies Demonstrated in this Project
- Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Analysis
- Filtering, Sorting and Conditional function.
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Chart
- Data Visulisation and Dashboard creation
## Goals and Measurement Benchmarks
The objective of this project is to create a **Road Accident Analytics Dashboard** for the years 2021 and 2022, providing insights on key aspects of road accidents. The dashboard will offer valuable information through various KPIs and trends, aiding stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

### Key Insights and Metrics:

- **Primary KPI**:
  - Total Casualties and Total Accidents for the Current Year and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth

- **Primary KPIs**:
  - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for the Current Year and YoY growth

- **Secondary KPIs**:
  - Total Casualties by Vehicle Type for the Current Year

- **Monthly Trends**:
  - Comparison of casualties between the Current Year and the Previous Year

- **Casualties by Road Type**:
  - Breakdown of casualties by road type for the Current Year

- **Casualties by Area/Location & Time**:
  - Current Year casualties categorized by Area/Location and Day/Night

- **Location-based Metrics**:
  - Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location

## Dataset Used
The dataset can be found [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R_uaoZL18nRbqC_MULVne90h3SdRbAyn/view]

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.

- Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors
- Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Creating 2 new attributes 'Year' and 'Month' were added for logical and easy interpretation of dataset.

üìà Total Casualties Analysis: The dashboard reveals that a staggering 417,883 casualties occurred after accidents during the two-year period

üìÖ Peak Months: Overall the number of casulaties were slightly higher in 2021 than 2022. Maximum Casualties happened in the month of October and November in both the Years and minimum casualties take place in the month of January and February.

üöó Casualties by Vehicle Type: Car accidents accounted for the highest number of casualties, contributing to 79.8% of the total. On the other hand, casualties were minimal in accidents involving other vehicle types.

ü©∏ Casualties by accident severity Slight severity form the bulk of casualties 84.1% whereas there are only 1.7% Fatal severity casualties.

üõ£Ô∏è Road Type Analysis: Maximum Casualties by Single Carriageway road type (310.1K) and Minimum by Slip road(5.1K)

üåßÔ∏è Casualties Distribution by Road Surface: Highest Distribution of total casualties on Dry road surfaces (67%)

üèôÔ∏è Casualties Relation by Area/Location Urban areas form the majority of casualties after an accident (61%)

‚òÄÔ∏è Casualties Distribution by light condtion: 73% of casulties take place in daylight condtion

## Recommendations based on the Analysis
By comparing casualty trends between the current and previous years on a monthly basis, the dashboard identifies critical periods of October and November. The road safety measure by the traffic police and other stakeholders must be active and focused during these high-risk periods.
Car drivers form bulk of the casualties so they must be targeted for awareness camps and strict monitoring, periodic check-ups on safe driving.
Extra safety measures should be placed Single Carriageway roads and they must be upgraded to double lane wherever possible.
Understanding casualty distribution based on different road surface conditions helps pinpoint areas where road maintenance and surface improvements are essential.
Urban areas should be targeted for interventions to improve road safety in specific and during daytime.
